# Social Login Android

This project was developed during the Android acceleration promoted by [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) (programming school), as part of the FullStack Web Development course. The objective of the project was to develop the login screen of a social network for Android devices, including layout and interface validations, without connecting to any API at this moment.
